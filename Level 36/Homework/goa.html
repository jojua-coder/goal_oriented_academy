<h4>Goa is the best academy in the world. It taught me a lot, not only me. I am sure that many children like Goa. Personally, I am very satisfied. I want to become a good programmer in the future and I am sure that I will. Now I will talk about Goa education itself. In Goa, any student can become a mini-leader, squad leader, mentor, and get a high rank, and all this gives us an incentive to learn better.</h4>
